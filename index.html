          <p> I know that you may not have heard of some of these things, but in the meantime, just don't comment.</p>
      <p>another few things I like are card games</p>
      <h3>card games</h3>
      <p>I really only have a top 3 for this one, so yeah.</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Yu-Gi-Oh!</li>
          <li>Magic the gathering</li>
          <li>pokemon TCG</li>
      </ol>
      <p> I love Yu-Gi-Oh the best, because, I was really hooked when I saw one of the manga being read by one of my freinds</p>
      <p>  and then I saw the very first episode and then just started dueling.</p>
      <p>my first deck was "the saga of the blue-eyes whte dragon", and from ther it just got bigger and bigger, and then I lost my deck.</p>
      <p> so then I got these yu-gi-oh cards for christmas, and they included my second favorite card, odd-eyes pendulum dragon.</p>
      <h3>favorite cards</h3>
      <p> so, I have a top 10 for this one (brace yourself!)</p>
